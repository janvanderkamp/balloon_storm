IMPORTANT: Your copy of version.h is replaced by a machine generated
version for each new build by PlayFirst, release engineering.

 * Only edit right hand side values in version.h

 * Do not add additional definitions to version.h

 * Do not change your game's resource file (ex: skeleton.rc/version.rch)
   in terms of where it picks up the version information from.

You may change the version information defined in version.h for your
own purposes, as long as you keep to the same format. However, please
realize that for games released through PlayFirst, this file is
overwritten by PlayFirst's release engineering process.  This means
that the build numbers that your game has for your own builds will
differ from the official builds that PlayFirst generates.  This is by
design. If you violate the guidelines here, you will be asked to
change your code back, so that your game source code will not break
the PlayFirst release engineering process.
